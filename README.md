# MainPortfolio

A simple portfolio of the various projects I have worked on in the recent past. 
While currently my primary focus is on front-end/UI design and development, I have strong appreciation of UX fundamentals and plenty of experience with graphic design.
I also really enjoy photography and I plan to pursue product photography on the side in the near future. 

If you have any questions or are interested in working together, please email me at momchil.kutev@gmail.com.

Cheers!
