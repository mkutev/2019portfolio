								<h1 class="major">Dungeons & Dragons Beyond Redesign</h1>
								
								<p><b>Project Type:</b> UX & UI Design, Concept</p>
								<p><b>My Role:</b> User Reasearch, Wireframing, Prototyping, Interfrace Design</p>
								<p><b>Tools Used:</b> Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, Google Sheets and Surveys</p>
								
								<p>Wizards of the Coast is an American publisher of board games, collectible card games, and roleplaying games (RPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). D&D is a cooperative roleplaying game, where players work together to explore a narrative adventure set in a fantasy world. It is the most prominent roleplaying game in the tabletop game community and continues to be the #1 best selling Fantasy game on Amazon.</p>
								
<!--								<p>This idea first started as a 4-week UX/UI project for my final-year Experience Design course, during which my team and I came up with an extension and partial redesign of the existing Dungeons & Dragons Beyond mobile application. Due to the short timespan of the project and difficulty with project scope, we were unhappy with the final designs and we all chose to individually revisit our UI designs down the road on our own. These are my personal updated redesigns for the existing D&D Beyond app featuring our proposed extension.</p>-->

								<h2>What is it?</h2>
						<!--<p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) first published in 1974. While its popularity has generally been rising since its first release almost 45 years ago, its strenghtening presence in popular meadia in the last 3-5 years have brough on a major spike of new attention and potential for Wizards of the Coast, the current owners and publishers of D&D.</p>-->

						<!--<p>Historically, however, the barrier of entry for newcommers to play their first game of D&D has always been and continues to be much higher when compared to all other popular table-top games.</p>-->
								
								<p>This project is an extension and redesign of the existing D&D Beyond mobile application geared towards people new to Dungeons & Dragons, focusing on teaching rules and gameplay through easily digestible and engaging lessons. The learning application provides the new adventurer with a personalized lesson plan based on what they’re interested in learning. Each of the lessons are structured to make learning flexible and can be taken in either as a guided, interactive format that uses narrative through storytelling and immersion to engage the adventurer (66% of survey respondents identified storytelling as a major interest), or a text-and-image format with a syllabus to allow for quick reading with key points. The intervention seeks to provide an easy and engaging onboarding experience to help ease a new adventurer into the world of Dungeons & Dragons.</p>

										<h2>Home Page redesign.</h2>
										<p>The current D&D Beyond app doesn't really feature a home page but rather seperate functionality-specific pages.</p>
										<p>This design features a new home for the app which provides a spotlight banner to serve as the launching point for the proposed onboarding experience as well as various other important content selected to be featured as time goes on.</p>
										<p>Below the spotlight banner, the home page focuses on grouping and showcasing other important content found within the app or on external platforms to further encourage the user to engage with already existing first and third party content.</p>
										<p>In the bottom of the page are chips to quickly bounce to a specific content needed for playing a and running a session of D&D.</p>

										<p>Once the questionnaire is completed, the user is presented with their personal onboarding guide, containing 1 to 6 different content chunks, based on how they responded to the 3 questions.</p>

										<h2>Play through or read through.</h2>
										<p>Playing through the guided walkthrough content allows players to experience more realistic interactions as they would happen in a real session of D&D, with the app being able to simulate different roles.</p>
										
										<p>If you are more of the reading type, you can quickly read through the summary of each lesson on your own pace.</p>
										
										<p>Whichever option you choose, the overall content you're viewing or interacting with would be for the most part the same.</p>

										<h2>Why is it needed?</h2>
										<p>We noted that on one side, the park's walkway ended in an old rail yard, and the current entrance to that side of the beautiful park didn't do it any justice. With this, we saw the perfect opportunity to locate our building at this location to create a much more pleasant entrance to the High Line, one that would better showcase the importance of this park within it's surroundings.</p

								<h2>The User and the Touchpoint</h2>

<!--								<p>Our realizations about the park led us to conclude that an art gallery on the High Line itself would be the perfect idea and would be a great fit to the already beautiful public space. After deciding with certainty on the idea, we again took a close look at the park and began to think about the ideal location of our building. We noted that on one side, the park's walkway ended in an old rail yard, and the current entrance to that side of the beautiful park didn't do it any justice. With this, we saw the perfect opportunity to locate our building at this location to create a much more pleasant entrance to the High Line, one that would better showcase the importance of this park within it's surroundings.</p>-->
