						<h3>Project Type</h3>
						<p>Freelance, JKA inc.</p>
						<h3>Personal Role</h3>
						<p>3D Modelling & Rendering (SketchUp, VRay, Photoshop)</p>
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>A project I did i
						 the summer of 2016 for residential construction of a beautiful property near Deer Lake, Vancouver. This consisted of creating a detailed and precise 3D model and complementary stylistic renderings.</p>

					<h3>Starting With Sketches</h3>
					<p>After construction began and the frame of the home was near complete, the owners returned from a trip to France and were very inspired by the style of the old French limestone estates and the design of the house was changed to fit this look. This meant very costly changes to the existing structure and thus my employer wanted to make sure that the owners had a clear visualization of their desired changes to aid them in making a final choice.</p>

					<p>For such a significant change of design, it was important that the owners got as accurate of a view of the final design in order to insure that they were completely satisfied, and that is where my job started.</p>

					<h3>Designing The Space</h3>
					<p>To create the 3D model, I decided to use a very common piece of 3D modelling software called SketchUp. I chose this program because I have a lot of experience with it and it allows you to create very detailed models in much less time than most other modeling software. In the architecture world, it is more commonly used for making quick sketch models of projects and rapid testing different ideas.</p> 
					<p>Along with the sketches, I was sent the latest 3D model of the home that someone at the firm had created, but unfortunately for me not only was the model outdated to begin with, but most of what was on there already had to be changed due to the owners change of mind. Thus I had to inspect the architectural sketches again and make note of what parts of the model would have to be totally removed and what parts I could reuse to save time.</p>

					<h3>Making The Model</h3>
					<p>After spending hours flushing out the details on the 3D model and consulting with the architect, I was ready to begin rendering the model out in order to create a much more realistic scene that would better represent how the house would look in real life. I started this process by going to the construction site on multiple different occasions and taking photos of the surrounding area at different times of the day. From these photos, I carefully selected different parts in order to try and piece together a scene that matched the feeling of the house's actual location.</p>
